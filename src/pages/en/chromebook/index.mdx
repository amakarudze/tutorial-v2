# Installation
In this tutorial you will be building a blog. In order to do that, as you go through the tutorial you'll 
be instructed on how to install various software on your computer and set up some online accounts as 
needed (if you are using local desktop environment) or instructed on how to create online accounts only 
(if you are using cloud development). This page gathers all of the installation and sign-up instructions 
in one place (which is useful for some workshop formats).

# Chromebook Installation
For people using a Chromebook or those with limited memory on their laptops, we recommend using a cloud 
IDE environment. This allows you to interact with the command line, Python, and Django directly through 
your browser, where a code editor is already installed. In case you using this instruction, some steps of 
the tutorial don't have to be done again ("Deploy/Git" [part](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/deploy/#installing-git) ). 
You’ll find a more detailed explanation in the “Deploy/Git” section.

Your installation experience will be a little different.

To set up your Chromebook, follow the instructions below:

1. **Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)** and sign up for a new, free user account. Be sure to 
remember your password (add it to your password manager, if you use one).

2. **Create a GitHub project**. Visit [this](https://github.com/new) link, use "my-first-blog" name 
for your project, and make it public (needed for deployment, you can make it private later). Also, 
add a `README.md` and `.gitignore` file.

3. **Start a Codespace**. Go to GitHub [Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new) and select the 
repository you just created. Click "Create Codespace".

    Wait a little bit and you'll see something like that:

    The [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) editor will open for you automatically. If you see a 
    notification that says "Install Python", please click on it. If not prompted, click the "Extensions" 
    icon on the left sidebar in the Codespace editor. Search for "Python" and click "Install."

    The bash terminal (similar to Linux) is at the bottom of the page.

    By default, the GitHub Codespace environment will be deleted after 1 month (this applies only to the 
    environment, not your code). To prevent auto-deletion, you can adjust the settings on the page: 
    https://github.com/codespaces

4. **Continue with the tutorial**. Follow the next steps from the section [Set up virtual environment 
and install Django](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/#virtualenv).
    Follow than sections for Ubuntu/Linux. Use the Codespaces command line (terminal), accessible 
    through your browser.
