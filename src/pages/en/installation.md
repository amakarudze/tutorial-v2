# If you're doing the tutorial at home

If you're doing the tutorial at home, not at one of the [Django Girls events](https://djangogirls.org/events/), you can completely skip this chapter now and go straight to the [How the Internet works](../how_the_internet_works/README.md) chapter.

This is because we cover installing things as they are needed in the tutorial -- this is just an additional page that gathers all of the installation instructions in one place (which is useful for some workshop formats). You can choose to install everything that is on this page right now if you wish. But if you want to start learning things before installing a bunch of stuff on your computer, skip this chapter and we will explain the installation parts to you later on, as they are needed.

Good luck!

# If you're attending a workshop

If you are attending one of the [Django Girls events](https://djangogirls.org/events/):
- Your workshop may have an "installation party" before the main workshop. If you are at an installation 
party, this page is for you! Follow the instructions here to get everything you need for the workshop 
installed, with the help of the coaches if needed. Then at the main workshop, you'll be able to skip 
installation instructions you'll encounter in the main tutorial when you get to them.
- The organizers of your workshop may have asked you to try at home to install everything on your 
computer before the workshop starts. If you have been asked to do that, this page is for you! Follow 
the instructions here, as best you can. Then at the main workshop, when you get to an installation step 
in the main tutorial, if you were not able to get that piece installed you can get help from your coach.
- If your workshop does not have an installation party (or you couldn't attend), and if the organizers 
didn't ask you to try to install everything before you arrived, skip this page and go straight to 
the [How the Internet works](/en/windows/01-internet.md) chapter. You'll be installing everything you 
need as you work through the tutorial.

# Installation
In this tutorial you will be building a blog. In order to do that, as you go through the tutorial you'll
 be instructed on how to install various software on your computer and set up some online accounts as needed. This page enables you to select your operating system and go to a page that gathers all of the installation and sign-up instructions for your operating system in one place (which is useful for some workshop formats).
